# Extractor Configuration Guide

This document explains how the extractor configuration works in the `cdf_fabric_replicator` project, with a special focus on the `retrieve_pipeline_config_standalone` method. This guide is written for both technical and non-technical readers.

## What is Extractor Configuration?

Extractor configuration is a way to manage and retrieve the settings needed for connecting and interacting with Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) extraction pipelines. These settings can be provided through environment files or example YAML configuration files.

## Why is this Important?

When working with data pipelines, it is crucial to have a consistent and reliable way to access and update the configuration that tells the system how to connect to data sources, what data to extract, and how to process it. This extractor configuration makes it easy to:
- Retrieve the current pipeline configuration from CDF
- Update the configuration as needed
- Ensure that the system is always using the correct settings

## How Does It Work?

The extractor configuration can read settings from two main sources:
- **Environment files**: These are files that store configuration as key-value pairs, often used for sensitive information or deployment-specific settings.
- **YAML configuration files**: These are human-readable files (with a `.yaml` extension) that describe the configuration in a structured way.

## Key Method: `retrieve_pipeline_config_standalone`

### What does this method do?

The `retrieve_pipeline_config_standalone` method is responsible for fetching the current extraction pipeline configuration from Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) using the provided configuration object. It updates the local configuration with the latest settings from CDF.

### How does it work?

1. **Connects to CDF**: It uses the provided configuration object to create a connection to CDF.
2. **Fetches the Pipeline Config**: It retrieves the extraction pipeline configuration using a unique identifier called the "external ID".
3. **Returns the Config Object**: The method returns the configuration object as it is, populated with the settings fetched directly from the extraction pipeline config in CDF. This means you get the exact configuration currently stored in CDF, without modifying your original local config unless you choose to use the returned object.

### Why is this useful?

- **Keeps configuration up to date**: By always fetching the latest configuration from CDF, you avoid issues caused by outdated or incorrect settings.
- **Easy to use**: You don't need to manually update configuration files; the method does it for you.
- **Reliable**: If there is an error during the process, it logs the error and stops, so you know something went wrong.

### Example (Simplified)

Suppose you have a configuration object and you want to make sure it matches what is currently set up in CDF. You can use this method to automatically fetch and update your configuration:

```python
updated_config = retrieve_pipeline_config_standalone(config, "my_extractor", "my_pipeline_external_id")
```

After running this, `updated_config` will have all the latest settings from CDF.

## Summary

- The extractor configuration helps manage and retrieve settings for data extraction pipelines.
- The `retrieve_pipeline_config_standalone` method fetches the latest configuration from Cognite Data Fusion and updates your local settings.
- This process ensures your system is always using the correct and most recent configuration, making data extraction reliable and easy to manage.
